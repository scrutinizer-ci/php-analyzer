PHP Analyzer Stubs
============

Please report bugs or feature requests via our website support system ``?`` in bottom right or by emailing ``support@scrutinizer-ci.com``.

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that works particularly well for server-side web development.


Contributing Stubs
------------------
PHP Analyzer uses stubs for built-in PHP classes and functions. These stubs look like regular PHP code
and define the available parameters, their types, properties, methods etc. If you would like to contribute 
a fix or additional stubs, please fork and submit a patch to the legacy branch:
